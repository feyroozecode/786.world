[786](https://vargiskhan.com/log/the-number-786-its-origin-meaning-and-significance/) is the numerical expression for “Bismillah al-Rahman al-Rahim” meaning "In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful".

[786 World](https://786.world/) is a muslim community which provides a place for people to 
meet other like minded people and discuss their faith or exist in a place with the knowledge that everyone shares the same beliefs and values.

## Rationale

Many of us have felt a disconnect between who we are and the environment around us. Unable to express our faith or beliefs. We're still struggling to find that community. Our hope is this place can help us all connect regardless of where we are.

## Guidelines

We don't condone negativity or hate. We promote equality and respecting differences. To anyone looking to invoke fear, hatred or abuse, there is a zero tolerance policy. Please do not bring islamaphobia to the group, please do not join to mock others who you don't know.

## Declaration

The [shahada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahada) is the first pillar of Islam. It is the declaration of belief in one, God, and his messenger 
Muhammad (peace be upon him). To join the community recite the following.

**lā ʾilāha ʾillallāh, Muḥammad rasūlu-llāh**

*There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is his messenger*
